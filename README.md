# Hangman
**Hangman Game**  This Python Hangman project is part of my #100DaysOfCode journey. 
It showcases key concepts like functions, loops, and indentation. 
Players guess letters to unveil a hidden word, with visual feedback using Hangman stages for wrong guesses.
The game's logo and stages are imported from separate files for modular organization.
